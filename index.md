# Cultural-Heritage-in-Bologna
To enhance accessibility and promote the preservation of cultural properties, the project aims to explore the Arco knowledge graph in order to illustrate the great variety of cultural properties that are present in the collections of Palazzo Poggi, select a few examples of artifacts, and and represent them using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) based on the ARCO (Architecture of Cultural Heritage Ontology). Moreover, new relevant knowledge will be produced in the form of RDF triples that could be added to the knowledge graph.

# Digital Heritage: RDF Representation of Marsili and Aldrovandi Artifacts at Palazzo Poggi
The Palazzo Poggi Museum in Bologna, Italy, houses significant collections of artifacts related to prominent figures of the history and culture of Bologna, such as Luigi Ferdinando Marsili and Ulisse Aldrovandi, who worked in the fields of natural sciences and early modern scientific exploration. Marsili is renowned for his work in military engineering, geography, and natural sciences, while Aldrovandi is celebrated for his contributions to botany, zoology, and geology. 
However, despite the large number of items belonging to these two great collectors, the artifacts present at Palazzo Poggi are not restricted to their collections alone. The museum's collections include a wide array of artifacts such as maps, manuscripts, scientific instruments, natural history specimens, and illustrated volumes.

### I. Methodology
1. We created a repository on Github (Julia).
2. We started from one of the examples that we found on Arco website.
3. We explored the knowledge graph to define our topic using SPARQL (Chiara and Gianluca). In this way, we connected different elements to our general topic in order to complete the project.
4. We used LLMs to find potential elements that could be added to the Arco knowledge graph (Aleksandra and Angelita).
5. We individuated a few details that could be added and improved on the knowledge graph.
6. We created the final website.
