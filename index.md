### I. Methodology
1. We created a repository on Github (Julia).
2. We started from one of the examples that we found on Arco website.
3. We explored the knowledge graph to define our topic using SPARQL (Chiara and Gianluca). In this way, we connected different elements to our general topic in order to complete the project.
4. We used LLMs to find potential elements that could be added to the Arco knowledge graph (Aleksandra and Angelita).
5. We individuated a few details that could be added and improved on the knowledge graph.
6. We created the final website.
