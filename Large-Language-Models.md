# Large Language Models

A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced form of artificial intelligence designed to understand and generate human language like humans. These models use complex algorithms and are trained on huge sets of data — hence the name "large." LLMs are built on machine learning, they are able to recognize and interpret human language because they have previously been trained using thousands or millions of examples (often gathered from the Internet). In order to understand how characters, words and sentences work together, LLMs use “deep learning” which allows them to recognize differences and similarities without the need of human intervention.
Large Language Models (LLMs) do not have genuine comprehension abilities. Instead, they operate by analyzing statistical patterns. LLMs rely on statistical analysis rather than true understanding to process and generate language.
