# 3. Conclusion

## Limitations

1. Structuring the queries due to the fact that we did not understand how to properly use the prefixes. We discovered that ChatGPT and the other LLMs sometimes "invent" properties that do not exist on Arco. So we found out that we could check the prefixes on the namespaces tables available on Virtuoso.
2. While for Aldrovandi collection all the items were directly linked to it, for Marsili collection there was not a direct link: we had to pass through a middle step "rdf: type a-cd: CollectionMembership". For this reason, we had to explore the knowledge graph to get the pictures and the categories of the items (e.g. ScientificandTechnologicalHeritage, and HistoricOrArtisticProperty). --> proposal of expansion
3. After struggling because of many discrepancies in Collezione Marsili, we discovered that the items were archived in two different collections: [Collezione Marsili](https://w3id.org/arco/resource/CollectionCulEnt/-bologna-collezione-marsili) and [Collezioni Marsili](https://w3id.org/arco/resource/CollectionCulEnt/-bologna-collezioni-marsili).
