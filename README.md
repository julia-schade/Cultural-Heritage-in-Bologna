# Cultural-Heritage-in-Bologna
Our project involves the exploration of the ArCo knowledge graph (with SPARQL). The goal is to identify entities and their RDF descriptions in the knowledge graph that may benefit from some enrichment, and to produce new relevant knowledge in the form of RDF triples that could be added to the knowledge graph. To enhance accessibility and promote the preservation of these cultural properties, the project aims to digitize a selection of artifacts and represent them using the Resource Description Framework (RDF) based on the ARCO (Architecture of Cultural Heritage Ontology). 

# Digital Heritage: RDF Representation of Marsili and Aldrovandi Artifacts at Palazzo Poggi
The Palazzo Poggi Museum in Bologna, Italy, houses significant collections of artifacts related to Luigi Ferdinando Marsili and Ulisse Aldrovandi, two prominent figures in the fields of natural sciences and early modern scientific exploration. Marsili is renowned for his work in military engineering, geography, and natural sciences, while Aldrovandi is celebrated for his contributions to botany, zoology, and geology. The museum's collections include a wide array of artifacts such as maps, manuscripts, scientific instruments, natural history specimens, and illustrated volumes.
