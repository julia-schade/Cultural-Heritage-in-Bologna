Our project involves the exploration of the ArCo knowledge graph (with SPARQL). The goal is to identify entities and their RDF descriptions in the knowledge graph that may benefit from some enrichment, and to produce new relevant knowledge in the form of RDF triples that could be added to the knowledge graph.
